"""ft-floatd: floating windows for the Frametop desktop (see docs/floating-windows.md).

Runs inside the desktop's Plasma session (its D-Bus and Wayland). It keeps the table of
which window floats on which spare output and panel, and connects three parts:
  - the KWin script frametop-float (float/frametop-float.js), which it loads into KWin. The
    script sends events over D-Bus (org.frametop.Float.Event) and fetches commands with a
    long poll (NextCommand).
  - ft-screens, through its control socket (@ft_screens): the spare output's size, and the
    floating panel's crop, density, place, and popups.
  - kscreen-doctor, to turn spare outputs on and off and place them in KWin's layout.
Commands and ft-screens' events arrive as datagrams on @frametop_float (ft-float is the
command-line side). Replies go to the sender:
  float [ID|active|pointer]   dock [ID|active|all]   close ID   list   quit   (ft-float)
  launch APP.desktop   run ["argv", ...]   (start an app and float its first window)
  windows   (-> JSON: the open apps' windows and where they are, for a profile; ft-layout save)
  profile NAME   (open a profile's apps: move the matching windows, launch the missing ones)
  ("float pointer" is the float key: the window under the pointer, else the active one,
  floated or docked; the input relay sends it for float_toggle, and "dock all" for dock_all)
  dock N | close N | resize N W H | scale N STEPS                      (ft-screens, N = its screen)
  front N   (ft-screens: a spin brought panel N to the front: make its window, or the top one
            on a screen, KWin's active window)

Spare outputs are WL-<screens> .. WL-<screens + slots - 1>. A floating window's output is its
frame plus a margin on each side (FLOAT_MARGIN pixels), so menus have room; the panel shows
only the window. Spares are placed apart from the screens and from each other in KWin's
layout, all within Xwayland's 32767-pixel limit.

Usage: ft-floatd [--screens N] [--slots N] [--margin PX] [--control NAME] [--socket NAME]
Defaults: FT_SCREEN_COUNT (from the session) or the layout's count, FLOAT_SLOTS and
FLOAT_MARGIN from ~/.config/frametop.conf (8 and 300), @ft_screens, @frametop_float.

Launching floating: "launch" starts a desktop file's app (Gio), "run" a command. The next
normal window from that process (or a child), or with that desktop file name, within
LAUNCH_SECONDS floats: where that app last floated, or in front of you. Single-instance and
D-Bus-activated apps open their window from a process that was already running, hence the
name. Each app's last floating place (its pose relative to the primary screen, so it moves
with the screens' layout), size in pixels, and scale are kept in PLACES_PATH, by desktop
file name, whenever one of its windows stops floating.

Profiles (docs/profiles.md): "windows" lists every app window with where it is: on a screen
(its rectangle on that output, maximized or not) or floating (its pose relative to the primary
screen, size, scale). "profile NAME" takes a profile's windows from the layout file: the
windows of each app already open (oldest first) move to its entries, and for the entries
left the app is launched once, and again for each window still missing 3 seconds after its
first one shows up (a browser restores its own windows; a terminal opens one each time).
Nothing is ever closed.

Launch as Standalone (float/ft_apps.py): copies of the apps' desktop files with that action,
which only the Frametop desktop reads. ft-floatd rewrites them when apps change.
